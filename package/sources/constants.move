        b"Verdant landscapes surround the young Tamashi with air in his lungs, and sun on his skin. His senses and muscles start to connect, as discarded parts of himself come alive again. Awakened by the brave new world, the uncaged bird starts to sing.".to_string(),
        b"As you think, so shall you become.".to_string(),
        b"When we start to think with our heads in the clouds, our minds drift to worlds of possibility. We break free from the physical world around us and instead dream of endless possibilities.".to_string(),

        b"I don't understand. Why do we need a TV head?\x0AIt's all marketing. Apparently drooling on a hospital bed isn't a good enough billboard. We do want them to volunteer for this.".to_string(),

        b"Through the sum of life's disjointed pieces, do we begin to define who we are.".to_string(),
        b"I love feeling the rays on my face, and the wind on my skin. Something about being out on the farm just makes me feel alive.".to_string(),
        b"If you have everything under control, you're not moving fast enough.".to_string(),
        b"I don't know what kind of life I want. I'm still figuring it out. But I need to go where I'm needed.".to_string(),

        b"You don't set out to build a wall. You don't say 'I'm going to build the biggest, baddest, greatest wall that's ever been built.' You don't start there. You say, 'I'm going to lay this brick as perfectly as a brick can be laid.' You do that every single day. And soon you have a wall.".to_string(),
        b"You know, we can only hope and dream of all the things we can be, right?".to_string(),
        b"Is everyone here ready to rock?!".to_string(),
        b"And wisdom is kept in our reality.".to_string(),
        b"When life gives you lemons, you should add some spice, cranberry, and even some vodka. Try mixing things up.".to_string(),
